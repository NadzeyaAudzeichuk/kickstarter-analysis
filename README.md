Based on calculated statistics:
*The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.
*The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.
*Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed *Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!
